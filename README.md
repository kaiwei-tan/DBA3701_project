# DBA3701 Project
Project done for NUS module, <i>Introduction to Optimization</i>, in Spring 2019
<br> Done by: Kai Wei Tan, Ang Rong Yi, Bernard Chua, Kang Hwee Chiat, Wee Zongyang

Part of a project using the Gurobi library to simulate a fictional 3-stop shuttle bus route (and crowd control system), evaluating the optimal number of passengers to let into the system in order to minimize their cumulative waiting time (man-hours). This code performs network optimization on a 20-node system followed by sensitivity analysis to determine impact of increasing seat capacity per vehicle on the bus route.
